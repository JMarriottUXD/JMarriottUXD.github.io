        <p class="article-lead">Creating a self-service help experience that improves findability, reduces Helpdesk demand, and enables a more scalable service model, supported by clear evidence for IA, content, and cross-channel decisions.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">My Role</h2>
          <p class="body-copy"><strong>Senior User Researcher </strong>embedded in a cross-functional squad.</p>
          <p class="body-copy">I led the research strategy across Discovery and design iterations, working closely with the Product Manager, UX and Content Designers and developers. I also facilitated collaboration with directors and Helpdesk teams to align service expectations and clarify the foundations of a future help model.</p>
        
        <h2 class="heading">Context</h2>
          <p class="body-copy">Self-service help emerged as a major pain point during strategic discovery. HL’s Help centre had grown to more than 1,000 unstructured FAQs with no ownership or organising principles, creating duplication, poor findability, and a heavy Helpdesk dependancy. This drive operational costs and made it difficult to support clients seeking support across complex financial tasks.</p>

  <p class="image-caption">I designed and faciliated IA workshops to explore different Help structures with SME's and the project team. This work took place during the COVID lockdowns, so I established online ways of running interactive, inclusive sessions.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">How I Led The Work</h2>
          <ul role="list" class="list">
            <li class="article-list-item">Aligned directors and Helpdesk teams around a unified help model by running vision workshops, analysing Helpdesk contact patterns and behaviours, and established foundational expectations for HL’s future help service.</li>
            <li class="article-list-item">Diagnosed systemic IA and content issues through a full audit, analytics review and a benchmark tree-test (showing 66% task failure), creating the evidence base that reframed Help as a strategic service problem rather than a content problem.</li>
            <li class="article-list-item">Co-created and validated a new IA via cross-organisational workshops and iterative tree-testing, achieving a 31% improvement in findability and major gains for high call-drivers (e.g. trading tasks rising to 93% success).</li>
            <li class="article-list-item">Guided rapid design and content iteration through targeted research, testing discovery behaviours, comprehension and prototype structures to shape principles such as “less is more”.</li>
            <li class="article-list-item">Strengthened delivery and cross-channel alignment by supporting user-story mapping and defining performance measures for launch.</li>

                    <li class="article-list-item">42% reduction in users going from Help to Contact Us (with comparable traffic).</li>
                    <li class="article-list-item">Significant increase in Help content discoverability: pages with >500 visits rose from 11 to 44, signalling easier access to relevant topics.</li>
                    <li class="article-list-item">New IA achieved 31% improvement in overall task success, with major gains on high-value tasks (e.g., +85% for trading queries).</li>
                    <li class="article-list-item">Delivered substantial internal efficiency gains: content editors’ average page creation time dropped from 9 hours to 5 minutes using the new CMS.</li>
