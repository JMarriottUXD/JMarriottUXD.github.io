        <h2 class="heading">Introduction</h2>
          <p class="body-copy">Our <a href="/hl-strategic-discovery" class="link-3">strategic discovery work</a> identified self-service help as a significant client pain point and opportunity to create a more sustainable service model in the face of increasing Helpdesk costs.<br/><br/>To deliver a truly effective solution, we needed to get the business thinking in terms of a holistic help service, rather than help as a collection of FAQ articles and phone lines. As the User Researcher, I worked closely with our Product Manager, UX Designer, Content Designer and development team to build a deep understanding of our clients needs when seeking help.<br/></p>
        
        <h2 class="heading">Engaging the business</h2>
          <p class="body-copy">A vision workshop with company directors built understanding of HL’s contact strategy and set expectations of how different help scenarios should be supported in the future. This enabled us to define the key foundational pieces required now and to align with wider strategy.<br/></p>

Coupled with a review of our analytics data, we were able to identify some of the likely pinch points in the existing service. These sessions also provided insight into common user tasks and the type of language clients use when talking about their accounts; a valuable input to the IA work that was to follow.</p><div class="img-center"><img src="images/helpdesk-20workshop-20-20alpha-20-20group-20ideation-20-2032.jpg" loading="lazy" width="2024" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 93vw, (max-width: 767px) 91vw, (max-width: 991px) 696px, 760px" srcset="images/helpdesk-20workshop-20-20alpha-20-20group-20ideation-20-2032-p-800.jpeg 800w, images/helpdesk-20workshop-20-20alpha-20-20group-20ideation-20-2032-p-1600.jpeg 1600w, images/helpdesk-20workshop-20-20alpha-20-20group-20ideation-20-2032-p-2000.jpeg 2000w, images/helpdesk-20workshop-20-20alpha-20-20group-20ideation-20-2032-p-2600.jpeg 2600w, images/helpdesk-20workshop-20-20alpha-20-20group-20ideation-20-2032.jpg 2616w" class="image"/><p class="image-caption">Workshop discussions with Helpdesk agents</p></div>
        
        <h2 class="heading">Thousands of FAQs</h2>
          <p class="body-copy">An in-depth review of the existing solution revealed a service lacking an underlying system or owner; resulting in over 1000 unique FAQs arranged without any clear organising principles. This meant it was almost impossible for users to find the information that would address their issue. <br/><br/>Our content-audit and traffic analysis revealed:</p>
          <ul role="list" class="list"><li class="article-list-item">The smallest amount of content drives the most engagement. For example, &#x27;How to...&#x27; FAQs make up 26% of content but account for 46% of page visits</li><li class="article-list-item">Content was grouped inconsistently, both by product and task, causing masses of duplication and users having to second-guess where to look</li><li class="article-list-item">Content was framed around very specific questions, resulting in lots of individual articles that all essentially covered the same points</li></ul></div></div><div class="img-breakout w-container"><img src="images/website-20-20main-20-20intro-20-206.jpg" loading="lazy" width="1200" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, (max-width: 991px) 728px, 940px" srcset="images/website-20-20main-20-20intro-20-206-p-500.jpeg 500w, images/website-20-20main-20-20intro-20-206-p-800.jpeg 800w, images/website-20-20main-20-20intro-20-206-p-1080.jpeg 1080w, images/website-20-20main-20-20intro-20-206-p-1600.jpeg 1600w, images/website-20-20main-20-20intro-20-206-p-2000.jpeg 2000w, images/website-20-20main-20-20intro-20-206-p-2600.jpeg 2600w, images/website-20-20main-20-20intro-20-206.jpg 2666w" class="image"/><p class="image-caption">We hypothesised that HL&#x27;s decision to frame Help content as questions led to massive duplication of content, making it harder for clients to find the information they need.</p></div><div class="container-body-copy w-container"><p class="body-copy">Based on our content audit, we began to explore different models that might better aid client understanding and improve findability.</p></div><div class="container-body-copy w-container">

Over the course of several iterations, we defined a new structure that performed, on average, 31% better than the existing solution.<br/><br/>Crucially, within that overall improvement we achieved huge gains in the findability of content that relates to high call drivers. For example, tasks related to trading queries had success scores of 93%, an increase of 85% from the existing help structure.<br/></p><div class="img-center"><img src="images/treejack-20task.jpg" loading="lazy" width="2024" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 93vw, (max-width: 767px) 91vw, (max-width: 991px) 696px, 760px" srcset="images/treejack-20task-p-500.jpeg 500w, images/treejack-20task-p-800.jpeg 800w, images/treejack-20task-p-1600.jpeg 1600w, images/treejack-20task.jpg 2000w" class="image"/><p class="image-caption">Tree-testing allowed us to compare proposed new structures against our benchmark, revealing big improvements in the findability of content for key tasks</p></div><p class="body-copy">Our IA work subsequently informed a restructure of the Helpdesk teams to better reflect the tasks our clients call about, allowing agents to more quickly and effectively resolve client queries.

  <h2 class="heading">Informing the future direction of Help content</h2>
      <p class="body-copy">Whilst the new structure and journeys were a big improvement, it was clear that the content itself would also have to evolve. We mapped the many existing FAQs against the new content types and grouped them around common topics to solve duplication.<br/><br/>Over the course of the re-write, we took the new content into research to gauge client comprehension of the information. This insight was then fed back into the content workflow.<br/></p>
  
  <h2 class="heading">Delivery</h2>
    <p class="body-copy">We created a user-story map to prioritise the delivery solution inline with clients&#x27; help activities and tasks.<br/><br/>This map focused us on delivering viable journeys as we moved through component structure definition, UI design and development.<br/>‍<br/>With the focus on structure, the foundations of the design solution relied on us developing sound typography and spacing rules to aid content comprehension. Using atomic design methodology, our components are reusable and provide foundations for the wider site. This results in consistency for users and development efficiencies.<br/></p>
