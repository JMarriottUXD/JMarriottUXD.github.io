        <p class="article-lead">Exploring alternative service models for Crown Court Billing to reduce provider (solicitors/barristers) and caseworker effort, address systemic inefficiencies across the billing workflow, and generate evidence to inform decisions about future process and technology changes.</p>
      </div>

  <div class="section">

        <h2 class="heading">My Role</h2>
          <p class="body-copy"><strong>Senior User Researcher </strong>leading the research approach across Alpha.<br/>I consolidated all existing insight, mapped the end-to-end service, facilitated prioritisation with operational teams, shaped hypotheses with the digital team, and led rapid testing with providers, caseworkers, LAA stakeholders and partner organisations such as the CPS.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">Context</h2>
          <p class="body-copy">The Crown Court Billing service is complex, policy-driven and supported by legacy systems that create significant friction for both solicitors/barristers (providers) and LAA caseworkers. Despite years of research, insight was fragmented, making it difficult to understand the full service picture or prioritise improvements.<br/>At the time of this work:</p>
          <ul role="list" class="list">
                  <li class="article-list-item">caseworkers were operating at 130% capacity, causing delays and backlog</li>
                  <li class="article-list-item">providers were experiencing slow, error-prone claim processes</li>
                  <li class="article-list-item">wider policy changes were on the horizon, increasing the need for a clear, evidence-based direction</li>
                  <li class="article-list-item">industrial action among barristers highlighted the urgency of improving the provider experience (even though remuneration levels were outside the scope of digital change)</li>
                </ul>

        <h2 class="heading">How I Led The Work</h2>
          <ul role="list" class="list">
            <li class="article-list-item">Consolidated 65+ hours of past research into a usable service view, creating maps that clarified actors, processes, pain points and system dependencies, and refined these with Caseworker Team Leads to capture operational realities and prioritise issues.</li>
            <li class="article-list-item">Identified two core problem statements; one for providers (high effort, errors, duplication) and one for caseworkers (disconnected systems, manual verification), to focus the Alpha on the most impactful opportunities.</li>
            <li class="article-list-item">Ran team sessions to form and evaluate hypotheses, assessing value, risk and technical complexity, and selecting three for Alpha exploration.</li>
            <li class="article-list-item">Led rapid testing of hypotheses using lightweight prototyping: describing “new world” workflows and having caseworkers demonstrate how they would assess claims under new assumptions. This enabled testing of service logic without the overhead of designing new interfaces.</li>
            <li class="article-list-item">Engaged providers, caseworkers, LAA stakeholders and partner organisations (e.g. CPS) through interviews, surveys and collaborative sessions to understand behavioural impacts, data constraints and operational feasibility.</li>
          </ul>

        <h2 class="heading">Outcomes</h2>
          <ul role="list" class="list">
            <li class="article-list-item">Evidence-led decision not to pursue the most ambitious proposed model, bringing clarity and closing down repeated discussions that lacked grounding in real-world feasibility.</li>
            <li class="article-list-item">Validated more incremental improvements that offered meaningful benefits for both providers and caseworkers and were prioritised into the product roadmap.</li>
            <li class="article-list-item">Raised awareness of provider and caseworker challenges across LAA Digital, feeding into strategic planning and resourcing for related billing initiatives.</li>
          </ul>
