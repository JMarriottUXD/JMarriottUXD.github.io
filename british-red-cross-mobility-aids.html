        <h1 class="heading-large-article">Mobility Aids Service Design</h1>
        <p class="article-lead">Understanding how the Mobility Aids service is delivered across the UK and explore evidence-driven concepts to improve the experience for service users, volunteers and staff.</p>
      </div>

<div class="section">
        
        <h2 class="heading">My Role</h2>
          <p class="body-copy"><strong>Service Designer </strong>responsible for planning and conducting contextual research, facilitating workshops and co-design sessions, and creating artefacts that enabled the Red Cross to visualise how the service works today and identify opportunities for improvement.</p>
        
        <h2 class="heading">Context</h2>
          <p class="body-copy">Mobility Aids loans essential equipment (e.g., wheelchairs, walkers, commodes) to people recovering from injury or sudden changes in circumstances. While vital, delivery of the service varied widely across the UK, shaped by volunteer availability, local operational constraints, and a complex ecosystem involving NHS partnerships, government bodies and charities.</p>
            
            <p class="body-copy">The Red Cross commissioned this work to gain a clear, UK-wide picture of how Mobility Aids actually operates and to explore improvements grounded in real user and staff needs.</p>
        
        <h2 class="heading">How I Led The Work</h2>
          <ul role="list" class="list">
            <li class="article-list-item">Engaged senior stakeholders to understand strategic priorities, pain points and the intended “hub and spoke” delivery model, building a baseline view of goals, constraints and expectations.</li>
            <li class="article-list-item">Conducted an intensive 3-week on-site research programme across seven UK locations, interviewing 90+ people (service users, volunteers, staff), observing daily operations, shadowing “delivery runs” and following equipment through its full lifecycle.</li>
            <li class="article-list-item">Facilitated co-design workshops with staff and volunteers at each location to generate and refine improvement ideas, then mocked up and role-played promising concepts to gather feedback on feasibility and impact.</li>
            <li class="article-list-item">Synthesised insights into actionable artefacts, including behavioural “use-case” personas, user stories, a service map, and an ecosystem map. These captured diverse contexts, workflow pain points, cross-channel journeys and dependencies shaping service delivery.</li>
            <li class="article-list-item">Developed service concepts, storyboards and supporting blueprints to show how proposed improvements would work across channels, systems and processes, enabling the Red Cross to plan for implementation.</li>
          </ul>

        <h2 class="heading">Outcomes</h2>
                  <ul role="list" class="list">
                    <li class="article-list-item">Provided a clear, evidence-based understanding of how Mobility Aids operates across diverse contexts, including systemic pain points affecting service users/proxies, volunteers and staff.</li>
                    <li class="article-list-item">Delivered actionable service artefacts that informed subsequent redesign and operational improvements.</li>
                    <li class="article-list-item">Several concepts developed during the project were later implemented, including; a new online ordering service replacing inefficient paper-based processes and improved donation and volunteering prompts to build sustainability and community engagement.</li>
                  </ul>
